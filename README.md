## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this plugin a replacement for [eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import) or [eslint-plugin-import-x](https://github.com/un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x)?

No for the most part. Fast import replaces a few select rules from import and import x that are known to be slow, but otherwise strives to coexist with these packages. It is recommended that you continue to use these other rules for more comprehensive import analysis.
